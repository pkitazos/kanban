# Kanban

Guys I had this great idea, what If I made my own todo app, then I'd finally be productive!1!

## TODO

- add save button that writes changes back into markdown
- add state management to handle multiple boards
- add task content view
- render markdown formatting of task content properly (bold, italics, etc.)

## Future Ideas

- add tags and priority to tasks
- add text editor to create boards in the app itself

## Distant Future Ideas

- turn this into a Tauri app, on launch you choose a directory (similar to how you choose a vault in Obsidian) and all the valid board files will be displayed as Kanban Boards, making changes to the board, will save the changes to the markdown files locally
